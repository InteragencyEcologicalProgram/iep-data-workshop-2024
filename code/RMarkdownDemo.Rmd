## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Code chunk options

Your R Markdown is broken up into 'code' chunks and text or 'markdown' chunks. Making nice looking R Markdown documents means understanding how to format your code chunks and markdown chunks appropriately.

<https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>

```{r options, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
load("data/processed/Dayflow.RData")

ggplot(Dayflow, aes(x = Date, y = SAC)) + geom_line()

```

## Formatting Markdown chunks

A few hints for the markdown chunks:

-   You need two carriage returns to start a new line.
-   Asterisks or dashes make bullets
-   Hash tag indicate headings
-   You can use html for fancy formatting
- css sheets are used for very fancy formatting (not covered here)

```{r}

```

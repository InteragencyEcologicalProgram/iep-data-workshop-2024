## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Code chunk options

Your Quarto is broken up into 'code' chunks and text or 'markdown' chunks. Making nice looking Quarto documents means understanding how to format your code chunks and markdown chunks appropriately.

<https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
load("../data/processed/Dayflow.RData")

ggplot(Dayflow, aes(x = Date, y = SAC)) + geom_line()
```


## Formatting Markdown chunks

A few hints for the markdown chunks:

-   You need two carriage returns to start a new line.
-   Asterisks or dashes make bullets
-   Hash tag indicate headings
-   You can use html for fancy formatting
-   css sheets are used for very fancy formatting (not covered here)
-   Use backticks to put code in text blocks `function(x)`

Quarto is an easy-to-write plain text format for creating dynamic documents and reports. See [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) to learn more.

## Figures

You can include figures in a text chunk

image: ![Alt text](figures/Big-Data-Kitty.jpg){#id .class width="300"}

Or you can include them in code chunks.

```{r Figure}
#|fig.height=4
#|fig.align="center"
#|fig.cap="Alt text here"
#|echo=FALSE

knitr::include_graphics("figures/cheezburger-image.jpg")

```
